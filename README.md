# Identity

*Identity* is a mod inspired by [Morph](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/morph), built for the Fabric mod loader (and recently ported to Forge).

**WARNING:** the 1.17.1 Architectury version of Identity (2.0.0+), which supports Forge & Fabric, is in a heavy beta state. Back up your worlds often and expect things to break.
