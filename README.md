# Walkers

*Walkers* is a mod inspired by [Morph](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/morph), built for the Fabric mod loader (and recently ported to Forge).

**WARNING:** the 1.17.1 Architectury version of Walkers (2.0.0+), which supports Forge & Fabric, is in a heavy beta state. Back up your worlds often and expect things to break.

With *Walkers*, you can become anything you want, friend or foe, hot or cold, fluffy or rough.

### Getting Started

Once you first joined a world, a menu will ask you to choose your second shape. You can switch to it by pressing "G". Choose carefully! This choice is forever! (Still, there's a creative-only command...)

### License
